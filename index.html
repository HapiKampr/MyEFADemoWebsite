        <h2>Amy Dilks</h2>
       
        What's in a Last Name? 
        As noted from House Of Names: "The origins of the name Dilks are with the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name is derived from the baptismal name meaning the son of Dilk. The surname was originally of Dutch origin and was brought into England during the Norman Conquest of 1066. Baptismal names began to appear as surnames relatively late in the growth of the naming tradition. This is a little surprising, given the popularity of biblical figures in the Christian countries of Europe. Nevertheless, surnames derived from baptismal names grew in popularity during the Middle Ages, and have become one of the foremost sources for surnames."
